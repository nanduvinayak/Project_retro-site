                        <p>From 1874, the Underwood family made typewriter ribbon and carbon paper, and were among a number of firms who produced these goods for Remington.[3] When Remington decided to start producing ribbons themselves, the Underwoods opted to manufacture typewriters.</p>
                        <p>The original Underwood typewriter was invented by German-American Franz Xaver Wagner, who showed it to entrepreneur John Thomas Underwood. Underwood supported Wagner and bought the company, recognizing the importance of the machine.</p>
